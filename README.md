# FA23-Beyond the Screen - AR Driven Insights

### Introduction
AR introduces a dynamic, three-dimensional platform for data visualization, making complex information more intuitive and accessible through interactive 3D plots, heatmaps, and bubble charts.This project leverages Augmented Reality (AR) to innovate the realm of data visualization by transforming traditional two-dimensional plots into interactive, immersive three-dimensional experiences. The aim is to significantly enhance users' comprehension and interaction with complex datasets, facilitating a more intuitive and engaging exploration of data in various domains such as education, business analytics, and scientific research. By doing so, we hope to provide a platform that allows for a more holistic understanding of information within a dynamic spatial context.

### Project Implementation
The project is implemented for mobile devices.So here we are basically using Plot-AR Python package with which we are using the Data Sets and Visualizing them in the 3D AR Environment. 


### How to Use

- Run the code in the Jupyter Notebook to generate a 3D data visualization.
- Upon execution, a barcode (QR code) is produced within the Notebook's output.
- Scan this barcode using a mobile device's camera to view the 3D plot in augmented reality.

Alternatively, if you prefer a static model for analysis:

- In the Jupyter Notebook code, ensure there is a line of code that triggers the conversion of the 3D plot into downloadable file formats: USDZ, GLB, and glTF.
- Run the code, and the conversion process will automatically begin.
- After the conversion, the files in USDZ (for iOS), GLB, and glTF (for Android) formats will be downloaded to your local machine.
- Transfer the downloaded files to your mobile device.
- Open the files on your mobile device to view and analyze the static 3D plot.

These steps provide two options for viewing 3D plots generated from the Jupyter Notebookâ€”either interactively in AR or as static models in supported file formats on mobile devices.
